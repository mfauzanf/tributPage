          A timeline of important events, achievements, setbacks and triumphs :
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1859</strong> - Nikola Tesla is born. Nikola Tesla is
            believed to have been born at midnight. During his birth, lightning
            struck during a summer storm. Born to a Serbian Family in Smiljan,
            Tesla was nicknamed `Child of the Storm`, by his aunt. That said,
            his mother replied to that comment by calling him `Child of the
            light`.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1870</strong> - Tesla's Brush With Death. Nikola Tesla moved
            to a place known as Karlovac to complete his high school. Three
            years later, he went back to Smiljan and shortly after his arrival;
            he contracted cholera. He was in hospital for close to one year, and
            he faced near-death circumstances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1875</strong> - Tesla Enrolls In College. In 1875, Tesla
            enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He was a
            disciplined student and achieved the highest grades possible while
            passing various exams. More so, he also started a cultural club and
            received a letter of commendation from the dean of the Technical
            Department. During his second year, he got into an argument with one
            his professors over the functionality of the Gramme dynamo
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1880</strong> - Tesla Moves To Prague To Study Philosophy.
            Tesla’s uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to
            finish his studies. He arrived late to enroll for classes, and his
            lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not qualify
            for the classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in
            Philosophy at the university, though he did not receive grades for
            the courses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1881</strong> - Tesla Begins His Career As Chief Electrical
            Engineer. In 1881, he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a
            telegraph company. Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest
            Telephone Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at
            draftsman in another company. A few months later, the BTS Company
            was in operation, and he was given the position of chief electrical
            engineer. During his tenure, he introduced various operation
            upswings which improved the performance of the company.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1882</strong> - Tesla Goes To Work For Edison. In 1882, he
            found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the
            Continental Edison Company. He began working in a new industry by
            installing indoor lighting resources. His company had several
            divisions, and he worked in the section of the company that was
            responsible for lighting systems. At this company, he improved his
            electrical engineering prowess. The management team noticed his
            abilities and soon introduced him as part of the team that would
            produce dynamos and motors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1885</strong> - Tesla Submits Some Of His First Patents. In
            March 1885, he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help
            in the submission of various patents. Serrel introduced Tesla to
            various businessmen, including Benjamin Vail and Robert Lane. They
            agreed to help finance a new light production company under Tesla
            Name. Tesla worked to acquire the patents for the company including
            developing an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained attention from
            the mass media who sought his solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1887</strong> - Tesla Re-imagines The Electric Motor. In
            1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by
            alternating current, a form of power that was becoming common in
            Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various benefits,
            especially in long-distance power transmission. In particular, the
            motor was operated by a polyphase current, which produced a rotating
            magnetic field to operate the motor. This innovative electric motor
            was patented in May 1988, and it comprised of a basic self-starting
            design that did not require the use of commutators. As a result,
            this reduced the occurrence of sparking the high maintenance that
            was associated with replacing mechanical brushes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1890</strong> - Tesla Begins His Work On Wireless Power
            Transmission. After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to
            transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling. This was
            through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous
            `Tesla coil.` He tried in many ways to come up with a wireless
            lighting system that was based on near field and capacitative
            coupling. He even performed various public demonstrations, where he
            would light up Geissler tubes to impress his audience. Tesla also
            spent close to well over a decade trying to come up with new
            solutions for lighting
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1891</strong> - Tesla Patents The Tesla Coil. In mid 1891,
            at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of the US. In the
            same year, he also patented his famous Tesla Coil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> - Tesla's Death. In early 1943, at age 86,
            Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York. He died alone, and his body
            was found by a maid who ignored a do not disturb sign on Tesla’s
            room. The assistant medical professional evaluated the body and
            determined the cause of death was related to coronary complications.
            A few days after the FBI ordered for the acquisition of his
            belongings, John G Trump was called in to evaluate his works. Trump
            was a well known electrical engineer who worked for the state, which
            was held in custody. Following a three day investigation, a Trumps
            report concluded that was nothing that would demonstrate a hazard in
            unfriendly circumstances.
